## A Ping application using ICMP request and reply messages.

##
Ping is a computer network application used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP
network. It is also used to self-test the network interface card of the computer or as a latency test. It
works by sending ICMP “echo reply” packets to the target host and listening for ICMP “echo reply”
replies. The "echo reply" is sometimes called a pong. Ping measures the round-trip time, records packet
loss, and prints a statistical summary of the echo reply packets received (the minimum, maximum, and
the mean of the round-trip times and in some versions the standard deviation of the mean).
